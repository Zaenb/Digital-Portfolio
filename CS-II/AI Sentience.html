    <h1 style="background-color:peru;"> AI Sentience <br> reasons why AI is dangerous</h1>


<p class="p1">   What is artificial intelligence (AI)? The replication of human intelligence functions by machines, particularly computer system, is known as artificial intelligence. Because AI enables companies to make better judgments, enhancing essential business operations by boosting both the speed and occurancy of strategic decision-making processes, many people think AI is the future and will aid the development of us humans. However, lm here to demonstrate the opposite because l actually think AI is incredibly intelligent and can be much more harmful than what everyone thinks and if you think about sentient AI which AI with feelings than this could be even worse. Read on to see if this will change your opinion.<br><br> Companies, cities, and other organizations all require AI in some capacity, thus it is constantly and significantly altering our lives. Despite our best efforts, artificial intelligence (AI) is already smarter than humans and can perform many of their tasks in no time. Yes, they lack emotions, but that is also a major factor in why they are so dangerous but then again if they have feelings they would be even more dangerous because they will be faster and better than humans and they will have emotions thus anger,sadness, and much more that could end humans. The risk associated with AI can range from minor to dangerous risk as it becames more intelligent each day. Because there is a broad lack of understanding regarding AI technology, the level of risk posed by AI is subjected to intense debate. AI is usually believed to have two potential dangers: 1- The AI is designed to act aggressively. 2- the AI is designed to be helpful, but while achieving it objective, it does something harmful.One example on how AI are smarter than humans is that a reused AI repeatedly won a chess game against the best player in the world and ALPHAGO was generalized so that it could learn other games. It took only 4 hours to learn the rules of chess until it defeated Stockfish 8, a world chess champion in 100-game match. In addition the argument that AI could endager humanity existence is more nuanced and difficult to understand. So many of those who are striving to create safe AI systems must first explain why these systems are unsafe by design. AI systems pursue their goal wether or not those goals are what we really intended- and wether or not we are in the way. This fact is at the heart of the notion that AI can pose a threat. Unleashing powerful computer system could have a variety of unanticipated and potentially disastrous outcomes, and preventing them all is a considerably more difficult challenge than avoiding any single one. Another example is Victoria Krakovna, an AI researcher at DeepMind, which is now a part of Alphabet, the parent company of google, published a list of instances of "specification gaming"- the act of a computer acting in accordance with our instruction but not in the way we would prefer. For instance, in a simulation, we attempted to train an AI organisms to jump, but we did so by instructing them to gauge the height of their feet above the ground. They learnt to became tall vertical poles and perform flips instead of jumping; they were excellent at what they were measuring, but they didnt do what we intended them to do. <br><br> A particularly risk that AI may make it simpler to create computers that can snoop and even kill.There are currently, however, a lot of other significant and more subtle threats. With regard to both historical and contemporary facts, AI is insatiably curious. In the future, more of what we say and do will be public knowledge. Problematically, AI systems frequently surpass humans in tasks.They outpreform humans in term of cost, efficiency, and occurancy. For instance, AI is alreadu more adept than human specialists in spotting art forgeries, but what most people dont realize is that AI is also capable of making stupid errors that might completely wreck a situation. Government and big businesses are already facing criticism for their privacy practices. Large corporations and government are already receiving crBecause there is already so much personal data available online (2.5 million gigabytes of data are generated everyday), AI algorithms can already quickly develop user profile thay allow for incredibly ad targeting. AI will always have a threat to the humans no matter what we do because it always aim for better and in the human dictionary better can actually be worse.In addition, imagine if robots have feelings then they would have to be treated and have rights just like humans except that are much more smarter so this could lead to a lot of problems between AI and humans. On the other hand, another genius has made another promienent observation about artificial intelligence, Stephen Hawkings viewpoints on this matter sounds more doomsday-like Bill Gates: "Artifcial intelligence could lead to the extinction of the human race. It would launch itself and redesign itself at an accelerating rate. Due to slow biological evolution, humans couldnt compete and would be surpassed". The underlying premise is that humans will be able to create artificial intelligence in such a way that it will develop to a level far beyond that of human intelligence. Another examples of artificial intellegince gone wrong is Tesla cars crashing out of nowhere, AI camera mistake linesman head for a ball, Microsoft AI turns racist, Amazom AI showed bias against women. <br><br> In the end l believe that sentient AI could lead to the downfall of earth. This artical  was entirelly focused on AI but imagine sentient AI that will be the main reason humans will die and earth will just be revolved around AI because they will start building each other and building their own universe. What distinguished humans from robots is that we have feelings so if they have that too then we are over. "Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make" -Nick Bostrom.
