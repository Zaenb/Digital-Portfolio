  <p class="p3"><br><b>TheFit (Deluxe Armario)</b><br><br><br><br>  <b>  Identity: </b><br><br> Deluxe Armario (Spanish word for: closet) assists in choosing(generating) an outfit for any situation or occasion. What makes our plan more unique is that it is inclusive which means it is developed for every gender, skin color, and body type and it concentrates on the trends that are now in style.
    <br><br><b> Problem:</b>
    <br><br>(Bazzar, 2016) "they found that it takes women and men 17 minutes each morning to settle on an outfit for the day"(P:10). No matter what time of day it is, choosing an outfit is very difficult and takes up a lot of our time. Alternatively, we may not always be aware of current trends, or you may not be able to determine what best suits your body type or skin tone.

    <br><br><b> Solution:</b><br><br>
    We can assist you in selecting an outfit with our (Deluxe Armario) generating methode. You only need to select your skin tone, body type, and gender and the setting you're looking for (party, casual, school, etc.) to ensure that you may select clothing that is both comfortable and fashionable and it will also choose a hairstyle for you.<br><br>

    <b> Target Market: </b><br><br> The intended audience is anyone who has trouble choosing or putting together an outfit, is primarily interested in the newest trends, or simply wants to know what looks best on them (body type) or what colors go with their skin tone.<br><br>
    <b> Competition: </b><br><br>
    After doing extensive research, I discovered that although many individuals had attempted the same idea, they hadn't developed it to the extent that we have, giving us up until this point no competition.<br><br>
    <b> Revenue Streams: </b><br><br>
    Our system will occasionally generate advertisements, most of which will be about fashion. We will also provide links to online stores where users may find items that suit their preferences.<br><br>
    <b> Marketing Activities: </b><br><br>By sending emails and social media advertisements, we will communicate with our customers, including (Instagram,tiktok, facebook, and youtube)<br><br>
    <b> Expenses: </b> <br><br> We haven't experienced any costs yet, but we're prepared to do so as we advance in order to ensure that our product reaches the level we need it to, and we'll also have to pay for advertising in the future.<br><br>
    <b> Team and key roles: </b> <br><br> Currently, our team just consists of the developers Zaenb Al Ameri and Jana Daouk, but as our business expands, we are happy to welcome new team members who want to improve our product.<br><br>
    <b> Milestones:</b> <br><br>
    as more people will learn about our product. We want people to feel more content and confident in their wardrobe choices. Hopefully, it will become a product that practically everyone uses and take less time to find an outfit.<br><br>
