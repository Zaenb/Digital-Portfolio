  <p class="p2">Considered Plan<br></p>
  <p class="p3"><br><b><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> 1- The cafe
	project</a></b><br><br> I thought the idea was clever and creative, but I don't think it's necessary in high school because you can get your food as soon as you pay. I also don't think pre-ordering is necessary because it will still take the same amount of time, say, till they find your name and the items you purchased. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophie-hews/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> 2- Foob </a> </b><br><br>  I like the concept because I believe it will benefit a lot of people, but I don't think it will always taste good because not all ingredients work well together. Additionally, I think it will be difficult to implement because it will require a lot of work, and people can just choose to make sandwiches or order in. I believe the concept would be better and I would have chosen it if it were based on an app that helps you select food in the grocery store according to your allergies.
    <br><br><b> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/eric-steiner/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">3- Fighting game </a> </b>
    <br><br>  It was a creative idea. But I think that school block games exist for a purpose. I don't really believe it is necessary, and because we are in class to complete our work and concentrate, we don't really need anything to distract our attention. It would be great if they created a game similar to Kahoot where people could have fun while also learning from it.
    <br><br><b> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/helen-giordano/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">4- AI Chatbot </a> </b><br><br>
    This was a great idea, and I'm sure many people will find it useful. The idea would be better if it were real people because people need other people in tough times. However, I think there are already websites like this, but they are little used, so it is not really worth it. On the other hand, we can't utilize AI in the project, so that won't work. <br><br>

    <b> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-nguyen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> 5- Restaurant Picker</a> </b><br><br>I picked it because I liked the idea, but I don't think it's actually necessary since you can just use Google Maps to view that information. Additionally, what if the restaurant the app chose wasn't the best choice after all? It might still have potential if they approached this plan in a more inventive manner.   

    <br><br> <b> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/cameron-farley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">6- Facial Recognition</a></b><br><br>
    This idea was my favorite by far. I think it has a lot of potential, but making it and distributing it to every class would cost a lot of money and time. I think teachers doing it is a much better option, and many teachers eventually stop calling attendance because they recognize your face by that point.<br><br>
    <b>  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/danelle-corbita/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">7- Motivation</a>  </b><br><br> I loved this because I procrastinate a lot and never finish things, so this app could motivate me by telling me when I would finish. It will also help young people organize their time, but I think there are already things like that or people can just plan independently because they know better

I really liked this concept and think I would use it instead of curtains, but I don't think many others will because there are already curtains and they will think it would be a waste of time and money. However,  I would definitely use it because I enjoy looking out the window.

If I hadn't found the other idea, I would have chosen this because I loved it. I will definitely use this since I really liked the concept, and I would love to talk to other computer science people to learn what to do and help them out._

    <b> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vivek-maranganti/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">10- code converter</a>   </b> <br><br>
This was my favorite, and I truly like the concept. I chose it primarily for this reason, as well as the fact that I know many other people would. and it would benefit a lot of projects because it saves so much time. People can also learn new languages and how they differ from one another through this.
