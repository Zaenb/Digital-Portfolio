  <h1 style="color: green;">
    This Digital Portfolio is very important to me because it explains what l have been through(my experiences), my hobbies, and my future dream.
    Hopefully, one day, l will share this portfolio with everyone and show them that although life isnt always simple, we must always mover forward, solve problems as they arise, and never give up .<b>You never know what will happen next because life is always changing. The piece of advice that l always follow while doing homeworks or in my everyday life is to aim for more in everything </b>. One day, l hope l achieve my goals, reread my Digital Portfolio to make sure l did what l said l would do, and then publish it to the world so they can see that life is nothing without challenges.</h1>
