  Hello, my name is Zaenb Al Ameri, although lm a junior right now, lm still just 15 years old because my birthday is on September 6,2006.My hobbies are baking, dancing, playing the piano, drawing, and learning new languages, l can currently speak Spanish, Arabic, English, and l can understand Korean. Fun fact: lm a ballerina, and l places second place in national competition.</br><br>This is my first year in the US because l spent my entire life in UAE, Dubai, and they have a completely different culture and language and my friends and family are there. Because of this, it was difficult for me to adjust to life in the US, but l had to do it because if l cant do that, what else will l be able to do in life?. Before we know it everything went by quickly and then school started, then, on the first day, l  met my best friend Jana, who made me adapt to the school and the US in general.

</br><br> Lastly, My goal is to either be a doctor or do something in computer science, l know that they are two different careers, but l love them both.l want to pursue a career that l love so that l can work hard and enjoy myself at the same time.</br>


  <b>My dream is to create a product that the entire globe needs, much like Iphone and cars.</b> </font> </p><meta charset="UTF-8">
