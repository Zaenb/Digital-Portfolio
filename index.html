<h1 style="color:purple">
  Hello, my name is Zaenb Al Ameri, although lm a junior right now, lm still 15 years old because my birthday is on September 6,2006. My hobbies are baking, dancing, playing the piano, drawing, and learning new languages. l can currently speak English, Arabic, Spanish and l can understand Korean. Fun fact: lm a ballerina and l won 2nd place in a national competion 2 years ago.<br><br> This is my first year in the US because l spent my entire life in UAE, Dubai, and they have a completely different culture and language and all my friends and family are there. Because of this it was difficult for me to adjust in the US, but l had to do it because if l cant adjust like everyone, then what else will l be able to do in life?. Before we knew it everything went by very quickly and then school started and then on the first day l met my best friend jana and she made me love school and l even adapted to the US.<br><br> Lastly, my goal is to either became a doctor or something in computer science , l know they are two different careers, but l love them both. l want to persue a career that l love and enjoy so l can work better.<b> My dream is to create something the entire globe needs.</b></h1>
